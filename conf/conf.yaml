# This is the sample config file. It contains the list of variables that are used in the dashboard. User can change or add new variables according to there requirement. 
# For now in case of adding new variable you have to define in the config file as well as add new parameter inside `replacer := strings.NewReplacer("$node", conf.Variables.Node, "$job", conf.Variables.Job, "$namespace", conf.Variables.Namespace, "$interval", conf.Variables.Interval, "$__rate_interval", conf.Variables.RateInterval)` in parse.go. Will find some better alternative for this in future

# TODO: Add support for multiple dashboard variable definition. Currently it supports declaration of variables for only single dashboard
variables:
  node: "node-exporter:9100"
  namespace: "namespace"
  job: "node-exporter"
  interval: "15m"
  rate_interval: "15m"
